# WebP

- [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) [WebP Tools](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) wrapper, 3 Templates.

Run `nim doc webp.nim` for Docs, `runnableExamples` included.

Right now is a wrapper for the command line tools, not the whole WebP Lib itself,
but we accept Pull Requests to add WebP Lib wrapping. (I need the Tools, not the Lib).

TLDR; WebP is like JPG but 25~50% smaller size.
