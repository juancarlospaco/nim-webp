[Nim](https://nim-lang.org) [WebP Tools](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) wrapper.

Right now is a wrapper for the command line tools,
not the whole WebP Lib itself,
but we accept Pull Requests to add WebP Lib wrapping.
(I need the Tools, not the Lib).

TLDR; WebP is like JPG but 25~50% smaller size.
